# Python-first-steps

Hi ya! :D
These are my first steps on Python!
Here we have 2 simple games: guess the number and the hangman game.
In order to play them it's very simple, just clone the repository and run the file jogos.py
Once you load the game menu, you may choose between these 2 games. 
Guess the number has 3 dificulty levels, wich will vary the nunber of guesses you have.
The hangman game has a wordlist in the palavras.txt that  are made of brazilian fruit names (PT-BR)
