# Python First Steps ðŸŽ®

This project contains my very first Python programs, developed in 2019 as part of my self-learning journey in programming.

## What's Included
- **Guess the Number:** A number-guessing game with three difficulty levels.
- **Hangman (Jogo da Forca):** Classic game using a word list of Brazilian fruits (Portuguese - PT-BR).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the file `jogos.py`.
3. Choose a game from the menu.

## Notes
- The word list used in Hangman is in `palavras.txt`.
- This project was my starting point with Python and I keep it here as a personal milestone.
